My existence is to extend love to all. Judgement toward others is judgement of projection.
Release others from projection by forgiveness.
On the human level, all behaviors are an extension of love or a cry for help and healing.
See the Brilliant Radiance in our Brothers and Sisters.
Forgive others, forgive oneself.
Doing so, heals me; and therefore, the universe.
